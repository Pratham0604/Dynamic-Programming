## Introduction to Dynamic Programming

Dynamic Programming (DP) is an optimization technique used to solve problems by breaking them down into simpler subproblems and storing the results of these subproblems to avoid redundant computations. It is especially useful for problems with overlapping subproblems and optimal substructure properties.

## Problems Implemented

- Fibonacci Number
- Coin Change Problem
- Knapsack Problem (0/1)
- Longest Common Subsequence (LCS)
- Edit Distance
- Matrix Chain Multiplication
- Partition Problem
- Rod Cutting
- And more...
